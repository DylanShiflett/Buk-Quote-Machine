["Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead.”, "Charles Bukowski"]
["For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can't readily accept the God formula, the big answers don\'t remain stone-written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command nor faith a dictum. I am my own god. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state, and our educational system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.” , "Charles Bukowski"]
["Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think, I\'m not going to make it, but you laugh inside — remembering all the times you\'ve felt that way.”, "Charles Bukowski"]
["what matters most is how well you walk through the fire", "Charles Bukowski"]
["If you\'re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don\'t even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you\'ll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you\'re going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It\'s the only good fight there is.", "Charles Bukowski"]
